## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity, dynamic content switching, and theme management.
- **Formspree**: For handling contact form submissions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for customization.

### Setup
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

### Live Demo

## How It Works

### Navigation
- Clicking on navigation links dynamically shows the corresponding section using JavaScript.
- The "Shop Now" button in the hero section directly navigates to the shop section.

### Theme Toggle
- The theme toggle button switches between dark and light modes.
- The selected theme is saved in `localStorage` and applied on page load.

### Contact Form
- The form validates user input and sends data to Formspree for processing.
- A success or error message is displayed based on the submission status.

## File Details

### `index.html`
- Contains the structure of the webpage, including sections for the hero, shop, about, and contact.
- Includes links to external stylesheets and scripts.

### `style.css`

### `script.js`
